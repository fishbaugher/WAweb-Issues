# What is this repository?

This repository provides an issue tracker for problems and solutions related to the Weatherization Assistant Web implementation.  It complements the ORNL-provided [Help Desk](https://weatherization.ornl.gov/contact-us/) but provides a public listing of known problems and solutions.  This repository is also a place to share files that may be related to WAweb workarounds or error characterization. 

The WAweb (version 10.5.x as of January 2024) is a new single-page application (SPA) hosted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  It is intended to replace the older desktop MS Access-based version 8.x (and prior) which has been in use for decades.

# Why is this repository useful?


This repository is a place for users to share problems, solutions, ideas for features, requests for new or modified features, or reports.  The issue tracker in GitHub is a good solution for this task since it is public, searchable, and editable, and it can store images as part of the issue. This lets us share screenshots that demonstrate problems and solutions.  A picture is usually worth 1000 words.

# How to participate?

The main thing here is the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/fishbaugher/WAweb-Issues/issues) which is the second tab in the main repository page right after 'Code'.  The code page is where shared files are stored and accessed. On that Issues page, you should be able to see open and closed issues, labels on issues, and a search bar.

Feel free to press the [New issue](https://github.com/fishbaugher/WAweb-Issues/issues/new) button and fully describe your problem or idea.  Screenshots are very helpful as well.  Just take a screenshot that illustrates the problem or idea, then simply drag your screenshot file into the issue comment area for everyone to see.

# Who maintains and contributes to the project?

The initial set of issues and ideas for this repository was contributed by WAweb users in the state of Minnesota, but the idea is to involve all users.  You can create issues and reply to other users in a shared environment.

Let's keep the focus on WAweb only in this repository.  Other DOE Weatherization program issues and discussions have their own forums.
