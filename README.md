# What is this repository

The main reason for this repository is to provide an issue tracker for problems and solutions related to the Weatherization Assistant Web implementation.  It complements the ORNL provide [Help Desk](https://weatherization.ornl.gov/contact-us/) but provides a public listing of known problems and solutions

# Why is this repository useful

The WAweb (version 10.5.x as of January 2024) is a new single page application (SPA) hosted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  It is intented to replace the older desktop MS Access based version 8.x which has been in use since 2005.

This repository is a place for users to share problems, solutions, ideas for features, requests for new or modified features, reports etc.  The issue tracker in GitHub is a good solution for this task since it is both public, searchable, and editable.

# How users can get started with the project

The main thing here is the Issue tracker which is the second tab in the main repository page right after 'Code'.  On that Issues page, you should be able to see open and closed issues, labels on issues, and a search bar.

Feel free to press the New Issues button and fully describe the problem/idea.  Screen shots are very helpful as well.  Just take a screen shot that illustrates the problem or idea, and simiply drag your screen shot file into the issue for everyone to see.

# Who maintains and contributes to the project

The initial set of issues and idea for this repository was contributed by WAweb users in the state of Minnesota, but the idea is for all users to be able to create issues and reply to other users in a shared environment.

Let's keep the focus on WAweb only in this repository.  Other DOE Weatherization program issues and discussions have their own forums.
