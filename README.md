# What is this repository?

The purpose of this repository is to provide an issue tracker for problems and solutions related to the Weatherization Assistant Web implementation.  It complements the ORNL provide [Help Desk](https://weatherization.ornl.gov/contact-us/) but provides a public listing of known problems and solutions.  This repository is also a place to share files that may be related to WAweb work arounds or error characteriztion.  

Note that GitHub issues directly support image files in each issue.  This let's us share screen shots that demonstrate problems and solutions.  A picture is usually worth 1000 words.

# Why is this repository useful?

The WAweb (version 10.5.x as of January 2024) is a new single page application (SPA) hosted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  It is intented to replace the older desktop MS Access based version 8.x (and prior) which has been in use for decades.

This repository is a place for users to share problems, solutions, ideas for features, requests for new or modified features, or reports.  The issue tracker in GitHub is a good solution for this task since it is both public, searchable, editable, and it can store images as part of the issue.

# How users can get started with the project?

The main thing here is the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/fishbaugher/WAweb-Issues/issues) which is the second tab in the main repository page right after 'Code'.  On that Issues page, you should be able to see open and closed issues, labels on issues, and a search bar.

Feel free to press the [New issue](https://github.com/fishbaugher/WAweb-Issues/issues/new) button and fully describe your problem or idea.  Screen shots are very helpful as well.  Just take a screen shot that illustrates the problem or idea, then simiply drag your screen shot file into the issue comment are for everyone to see.

# Who maintains and contributes to the project?

The initial set of issues and idea for this repository was contributed by WAweb users in the state of Minnesota, but the idea is to involve all users.  You can create issues and reply to other users in a shared environment.

Let's keep the focus on WAweb only in this repository.  Other DOE Weatherization program issues and discussions have their own forums.
